# odin-recipes
I utilized HTML to create a basic website that involved 3 recipes from Allrecipes (creators credited via links). Utilized links, heading tags, image tags, unordered and ordered listings as well as figures and figcaptions to add titles to a couple of the lists on Asian Orange Chicken. I also added an icon that displays next to the title of the page.

This was my first project completed during The Odin Project curriculum!
